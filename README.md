# DesignPatterns-HowTo
This repository contains a simple Java SE project, the aim of this project is to put into implementation the patterns and practices covered in the Heads First: Design Patterns book I am currently self-studying from.

We start of with the fourth chapter the Factory pattern and its' three branches, the SimpleFactory pattern, the FactoryMethod pattern and the AbstractFactory pattern. Each implementation will be covered and documentation will be provided throughout the code.
